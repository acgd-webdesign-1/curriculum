      ## What & why

      When learning about accessibility & HTML semantics it’s difficult to understand what’s helpful.

      By practicing defining an interface through text & speech we can more clearly understand what’s helpful.

      **Text is one of the most important accessibility tools—with some practice we can help everybody use our website.**

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs
      2. Get out a pencil and a piece of paper or do it digitally
      3. We’ll do each activity one-by-one and discuss the results
        <br>*Volunteers can even read their solutions out in robot voices!*

      **Don’t look ahead the answers are within!**

      ## Instructions

      *Describe each interface with only text, like a computer or a screen reader.*

      - What should be described?
      - What order should the information be described?
      - Are there elements that have functionality?
      - Are there repeated patterns?
      - What should be read for a person to interact properly?
