      ## What & why

      When learning to make sitemaps, it can be helpful to work backwards: starting with a complete site.

      Using a complete site as a starting point will help us understand how websites are structured & what to show in sitemaps.

      **With some practice, we can pre-plan sitemaps for websites that don’t yet exist.**

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs
      1. Get out a pencil & some paper (or do it digitally)

      ## Instructions

      1. [Navigate to StarWars.com](https://www.starwars.com/)
      2. Click through the pages and get an understanding of how things are connected
      3. Draw a sitemap that shows how the website is connected

      **There are lots of pages on this website—you can’t express them all in your sitemap.** *Try to group & categorize the pages & navigation.*
