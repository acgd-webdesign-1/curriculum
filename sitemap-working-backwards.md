      ## What & why

      When learning to make sitemaps, it can be helpful to work backwards: starting with a complete site.

      Using a complete site as a starting point will help us understand how websites are structured & what to show in sitemaps.

      **With some practice, we can pre-plan sitemaps for websites that don’t yet exist.**
